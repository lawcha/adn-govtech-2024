{"query":"Moving to Switzerland:
Identification: Microchip (ISO 11784, readable by reader compliant with ISO 11785). Identification must take place before the anti-rabies vaccination.
Valid anti-rabies vaccination: A anti-rabies vaccination is valid from the 21st day after completion of the vaccination protocol or the date of the booster vaccination, if the vaccine is administered within the validity period stipulated by the manufacturer. It is valid as stipulated by the manufacturer if the expiry date was entered in the pet passport or veterinary certificate by an authorised veterinary practitioner. Otherwise, the period of validity is one year. The first vaccination must not be given before the age of 12 weeks.
Veterinary certificate and owner’s declaration: The animals must be accompanied by a veterinary certificate and owner’s declaration. Only the stamped and signed original will be accepted. It must be drawn up in German, French, Italian or English or be accompanied by a certified translation into one of these languages. You can find here the [model veterinary certificate and owner’s declaration]( https://www.blv.admin.ch/dam/blv/en/dokumente/tiere/reisen-mit-heimtieren/model-of-health-certificate-and-declaration-2.pdf.download.pdf/Certificate Dog Cat Ferret Non Commercial Aug 2019.pdf). to use.
The veterinary certificate must be issued by an official veterinarian in your country of origin. It is valid for 10 days from the date of issue.
Control: Pets entering Switzerland by air will be checked by customs. They must be presented at the red customs exit. If the entry conditions are not fulfilled, or if the required documentation is incomplete, the animal will be taken to the border veterinary office in the freight area of the airport for further processing. All costs arising will be borne by the keeper.
Accompanied entry: Any pet that does not enter Switzerland in the passenger cabin with its keeper accompanying it, but in the hold of the aircraft, must be checked in as “AVI in hold” or “excess baggage”. This makes it clear to all concerned (airline, border veterinary officers, customs) that the animal is accompanied. If the animal travels with a separate air consignment note, it will be treated as a freight shipment on arrival at the airport and taken to the animal facility. This will mean additional costs and time for the accompanying person.
Unaccompanied entry: If a pet (dog, cat or ferret) cannot enter the country accompanied by its keeper, it may travel as air freight. In this case different formalities apply. Unaccompanied pets can only enter the country via Zurich and Geneva airports. An unaccompanied pet may enter the country within 5 days before or after its keeper’s arrival. If this time frame cannot be complied with, it must be ascertained whether the animal was already in the care of its keeper in the country of origin. The relevant information and documents must be sent to the FSVO for assessment.
If you enter Switzerland overland via the EU, the border veterinary inspection is carried out on entry into the EU. Entries from the EU into Switzerland are subject to random checks by customs to ensure compliance with entry regulations.
It is prohibited to enter Switzerland with cropped or docked dogs (ears and/or tail). Regarding possible exceptions (short stay/holidays, moving house), please consult the animal welfare information [Questions and answers on dogs with short tails or clipped ears]( https://www.blv.admin.ch/dam/blv/en/dokumente/import-export/import/fragen-antworten-rund-um-coupierte-hunde-db.pdf.download.pdf/Fragen_und_Antworten_rund_um_coupierte_Hunde-en.pdf).
Exceptions are made for people moving to Switzerland. Customs decide whether the criteria for an exception are met.
As a dog owner, you are required to register your animal(s) in your Swiss place of residence. Your veterinarian must additionally register the dog(s) in the Swiss dog database (AMICUS) within 10 days.
Ask the local authority in Switzerland either at your holiday destination or, if you are moving, in the place where you plan to live, about special requirements with regard to permitted dog breeds, keeping animals on a leash or using a muzzle.
This regulation applies solely to pets which are kept out of interest in the animal or as a household companion. Pets accompany their keepers or a person designated by the keepers.
After being taken over the border, pets must not be sold or handed over to new keepers. They must already be in the care of their current keeper in the country of origin.
If this is not the case, the import conditions for imports for commercial purposes apply. Information on this is available under:
