{"query":"I am travelling to: Germany
I live in Switzerland and I am taking dogs, cats or ferrets abroad with me on holiday
 1 Dog(s), older than 7 months, Germany
Entering the holiday destination country:
In view of the many different regulations governing imports, we refer you to the
authorities in your country of destination: please contact the embassy, consulate
or veterinary authorities in your country of destination in good time to enquire
about the regulations on entry with dogs, cats or ferrets.
Returning to Switzerland:
Identification: Microchip (ISO 11784, readable by reader compliant with ISO
11785). Identification must take place before the anti-rabies vaccination.
Valid anti-rabies vaccination: A anti-rabies vaccination is valid from the 21st
day after completion of the vaccination protocol or the date of the booster
vaccination, if the vaccine is administered within the validity period stipulated by
the manufacturer. It is valid as stipulated by the manufacturer if the expiry date
was entered in the pet passport or veterinary certificate by an authorised
veterinary practitioner. Otherwise, the period of validity is one year. The first
vaccination must not be given before the age of 12 weeks.
Pet passport: The animals must be accompanied by an EU pet passport or an
EU-recognised pet passport of other European states or territories (Switzerland,
Andorra, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Northern Ireland, Norway, San Marino,
Vatican City) if they originally come from there.
If your dog has had its tail or ears cropped, it may re-enter Switzerland only if
the veterinary service of the canton of residence confirmed in the Swiss pet
passport and in the AMICUS dog database before it left Switzerland that the
animal meets the animal welfare requirements for re-entry. For more information,
please see the animal welfare information [Questions and answers on cropped
and docked dogs](https://www.blv.admin.ch/dam/blv/en/dokumente/import-
export/import/fragen-antworten-rund-um-coupierte-hunde-db.pdf).
This regulation applies solely to pets which are kept out of interest in the animal
or as a household companion. Pets accompany their keepers or a person
designated by the keepers.
