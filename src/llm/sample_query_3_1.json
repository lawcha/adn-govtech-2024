{"query":"I come from: United States (incl. American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico and US Virgin Islands)
I am moving to Switzerland with dogs, cats or ferrets
1 Dog(s), between 16 weeks and 7 months, USA
Moving to Switzerland:
Identification: Microchip (ISO 11784, readable by reader compliant with ISO 11785). Identification must take place before the anti-rabies vaccination.
Valid anti-rabies vaccination: A anti-rabies vaccination is valid from the 21st day after completion of the vaccination protocol or the date of the booster vaccination, if the vaccine is administered within the validity period stipulated by the manufacturer. It is valid as stipulated by the manufacturer if the expiry date was entered in the pet passport or veterinary certificate by an authorised veterinary practitioner. Otherwise, the period of validity is one year. The first vaccination must not be given before the age of 12 weeks.
Veterinary certificate and owner’s declaration: The animals must be accompanied by a veterinary certificate and owner’s declaration. Only the stamped and signed original will be accepted. It must be drawn up in German, French, Italian or English or be accompanied by a certified translation into one of these languages. You can find here the [model veterinary certificate and owner’s declaration]( https://www.blv.admin.ch/dam/blv/en/dokumente/tiere/reisen-mit-heimtieren/model-of-health-certificate-and-declaration-2.pdf.download.pdf/Certificate Dog Cat Ferret Non Commercial Aug 2019.pdf). to use.
The veterinary certificate must be issued by an official veterinarian in your country of origin. It is valid for 10 days from the date of issue.
Control: Pets entering Switzerland by air will be checked by customs. They must be presented at the red customs exit. If the entry conditions are not fulfilled, or if the required documentation is incomplete, the animal will be taken to the border veterinary office in the freight area of the airport for further processing. All costs arising will be borne by the keeper.
Accompanied entry: Any pet that does not enter Switzerland in the passenger cabin with its keeper accompanying it, but in the hold of the aircraft, must be checked in as “AVI in hold” or “excess baggage”. This makes it clear to all concerned (airline, border veterinary officers, customs) that the animal is accompanied. If the animal travels with a separate air consignment note, it will be treated as a freight shipment on arrival at the airport and taken to the animal facility. This will mean additional costs and time for the accompanying person.
Unaccompanied entry: If a pet (dog, cat or ferret) cannot enter the country accompanied by its keeper, it may travel as air freight. In this case different formalities apply. Unaccompanied pets can only enter the country via Zurich and Geneva airports. An unaccompanied pet may enter the country within 5 days before or after its keeper’s arrival. If this time frame cannot be complied with, it must be ascertained whether the animal was already in the care of its keeper in the country of origin. The relevant information and documents must be sent to the FSVO for assessment.
If you enter Switzerland overland via the EU, the border veterinary inspection is carried out on entry into the EU. Entries from the EU into Switzerland are subject to random checks by customs to ensure compliance with entry regulations.
It is prohibited to enter Switzerland with cropped or docked dogs (ears and/or tail). Regarding possible exceptions (short stay/holidays, moving house), please consult the animal welfare information [Questions and answers on dogs with short tails or clipped ears]( https://www.blv.admin.ch/dam/blv/en/dokumente/import-export/import/fragen-antworten-rund-um-coupierte-hunde-db.pdf.download.pdf/Fragen_und_Antworten_rund_um_coupierte_Hunde-en.pdf).
Exceptions are made for people moving to Switzerland. Customs decide whether the criteria for an exception are met.
As a dog owner, you are required to register your animal(s) in your Swiss place of residence. Your veterinarian must additionally register the dog(s) in the Swiss dog database (AMICUS) within 10 days.
Ask the local authority in Switzerland either at your holiday destination or, if you are moving, in the place where you plan to live, about special requirements with regard to permitted dog breeds, keeping animals on a leash or using a muzzle.
This regulation applies solely to pets which are kept out of interest in the animal or as a household companion. Pets accompany their keepers or a person designated by the keepers.
After being taken over the border, pets must not be sold or handed over to new keepers. They must already be in the care of their current keeper in the country of origin.
If this is not the case, the import conditions for imports for commercial purposes apply. Information on this is available under:
[Import for commercial purposes from EU]( https://www.blv.admin.ch/blv/en/home/import-und-export/import/importe-aus-der-eu/lebende-tiere-aus-der-eu/hunde-katzen-fraettchen-eu.html)

If an animal has been in a country with a rabies risk in the 6 months before or during the journey to Switzerland, the conditions for countries with a rabies risk apply. For more information, please search online using the relevant query option (chose applying rabies risk country). Animals that have not left the transit area of an international airport when travelling via a rabies risk country are exempted from this provision.
This information was compiled with the utmost care and to the best of our knowledge. However, the only legally binding text is the original text of the [Ordinance on the Import, Transit and Export of Pet Animals (OITE-AC in French)](http://www.admin.ch/opc/fr/classified-compilation/20140652/index.html).

For the accompanied entry into Switzerland from a rabies risk country, the animal (dog, cat or ferret) requires the following:
Microchip
The microchip must be readable and been implanted BEFORE the rabies vaccination.
Valid rabies vaccination
A rabies vaccination can only be recognized as valid if the microchip was implanted before the vaccination. The rabies vaccination is not valid if it is carried out before the animal has reached the age of 12 weeks.
Blood analysis
A blood sample must be taken from the animal no sooner than 30 days after the rabies vaccination (but within the validity period of the vaccination) and this sample must undergo analysis for rabies antibodies. This analysis must be carried out in a laboratory approved by the EU. A list of approved laboratories can be found at http://ec.europa.eu/food/animals/pet-movement/approved-labs_en.
The blood analysis is followed by a further waiting period of 3 months until entry into Switzerland is possible, provided the result is at least 0.5 IU/mL.
FSVO import permit
To enter Switzerland via a Swiss airport, a permit issued by the FSVO is required. To obtain a permit, you must send the following documents to the FSVO at least 3 weeks before your departure: a copy of the laboratory report on the blood analysis, microchip certificate with date of implantation, certificate of rabies vaccinations and the application form. The permit costs CHF40. This fee is collected by customs upon entry. A sample of the application form can be found on the link mentioned above at the bottom of the page under 'More Information' > Forms > Application form for pets from a country with rabies risk.
Veterinary certificate and declaration of ownership
Must be issued by the official veterinarian responsible or the authorities responsible in the country of origin. A sample of the model veterinary certificate and declaration of ownership can be found on our website (see link above) at the bottom of the page under 'More Information' > Forms > Veterinary certificate and ownership declaration for entry from a third country. Attention: This certificate is valid for 10 days from the date of issue by the official veterinarian.
We draw your attention to the fact that, if the dogs do not fly with the owner in the passenger cabin, but are carried in the hold, it is absolutely essential to make sure the dogs are checked in as “AVI in Hold” or “Excess baggage”. This makes it clear for all parties involved (airline, border veterinarians and customs) that the animals are accompanied by the owner.
If the dogs do not travel with you in the same aircraft, please contact us again, because in this case the rules for entry differ slightly from those described above.
The following also applies:
Before bringing your dog into the country, contact the cantonal veterinary office to enquire about any restrictions or requirements for your breed of dog. A list of cantonal veterinary offices with addresses and telephone numbers can be found at https://www.blv.admin.ch/blv/en/home/das-blv/organisation/veterinaerdienst-schweiz.html.
If you are bringing your animal into Switzerland on a permanent basis:  Then the animal is subject to value-added tax; please contact the customs authorities in this regard on arrival.
Contact your local municipality to register as a dog owner in the AMICUS database.
Ask your Swiss veterinary surgeon to register your dog in the AMICUS database.
The entry/importation of dogs with cropped ears or a docked tail into Switzerland is prohibited subject to a few exceptions.
