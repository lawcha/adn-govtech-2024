{"query":"I bring dogs, cats or ferrets with me from: Thailand I live in Switzerland and want to bring dogs, cats or ferrets from a foreign country to Switzerland 1 Cat(s), older than 7 months, Thailand To be permitted to enter Switzerland, your animals must meet the following conditions: Identification: Microchip (ISO 11784, readable by reader compliant with ISO 11785). Identification must take place before the anti-rabies vaccination. Valid anti-rabies vaccination: A anti-rabies vaccination is valid from the 21st day after completion of the vaccination protocol or the date of the booster vaccination, if the vaccine is administered within the validity period stipulated by the manufacturer. It is valid as stipulated by the manufacturer if the expiry date was entered in the pet passport or veterinary certificate by an authorised veterinary practitioner. Otherwise, the period of validity is one year. The first vaccination must not be given before the age of 12 weeks. Titration of antibodies: Blood testing is necessary to confirm the effectiveness of rabies vaccination. A blood sample must be taken from the animal no earlier than 30 days after vaccination (but within the validity period of the vaccination). The veterinary practitioner sends the blood sample to an[EU-approved laboratory](https://food.ec.europa.eu/animals/movement-pets/approved-rabies- serology-laboratories_en). for testing.The blood test serves as evidence of adequate vaccine protection. A result of at least 0.5 IU/ml is considered sufficient. Animals with lower test results may not enter Switzerland. The blood analysis is followed by a further waiting period of at least 3 months (from date of sampling) in the country with a rabies risk, after which entry is possible. Entry with young animals from countries with a rabies risk is therefore not possible until the animals are at least 7 months old. Exception: The three-month waiting period between blood test and entry does not apply if vaccination and titration of antibodies were carried out before the animal left Switzerland or the EU. Blood testing need not be repeated after booster vaccinations if the latter are carried out, without exception, within the validity period stipulated by the manufacturer. Veterinary certificate and owner’s declaration: The animals must be accompanied by a veterinary certificate and owner’s declaration. Only the stamped and signed original will be accepted. It must be drawn up in German, French, Italian or English or be accompanied by a certified translation into one of these languages. You can find here the [model veterinary certificate and owner’s declaration](https://www.blv.admin.ch/dam/blv/en/dokumente/tiere/reisen-mit- heimtieren/model-of-health-certificate-and-declaration- 2.pdf.download.pdf/Certificate Dog Cat Ferret Non Commercial Aug 2019.pdf). to use. The veterinary certificate must be issued by an official veterinarian in your country of origin. It is valid for 10 days from the date of issue. FSVO permit: For entry into Switzerland from a country with a rabies risk by a direct air route, a permit must be requested from the FSVO. In these cases, entry is only possible via the airports of Basel, Geneva and Zurich. Applications must be submitted and the necessary documents received no later than 3 weeks before the intended date of entry. For more information, please see the relevant [applicationform](https://www.blv.admin.ch/dam/blv/en/dokumente/tiere/r eisen-mit-heimtieren/gesuchsformular-heimtier-tollwutrisikoland.docx). The FSVO may enter the permit in the Swiss pet passport. If a booster vaccination is given within the validity period of the previous rabies vaccination, the veterinary practitioner may extend the validity of the permit. Control: Pets entering Switzerland by air will be checked by customs. They must be presented at the red customs exit. If the entry conditions are not fulfilled, or if the required documentation is incomplete, the animal will be taken to the border veterinary office in the freight area of the airport for further processing. All costs arising will be borne by the keeper. Accompanied entry: Any pet that does not enter Switzerland in the passenger cabin with its keeper accompanying it, but in the hold of the aircraft, must be checked in as “AVI in hold” or “excess baggage”. This makes it clear to all concerned (airline, border veterinary officers, customs) that the animal is accompanied. If the animal travels with a separate air consignment note, it will be treated as a freight shipment on arrival at the airport and taken to the animal facility. This will mean additional costs and time for the accompanying person. Unaccompanied entry: If a pet (dog, cat or ferret) cannot enter the country accompanied by its keeper, it may travel as air freight. In this case different formalities apply. Unaccompanied pets can only enter the country via Zurich and Geneva airports. An unaccompanied pet may enter the country within 5 days before or after its keeper’s arrival. If this time frame cannot be complied with, it must be ascertained whether the animal was already in the care of its keeper in the country of origin. The relevant information and documents must be sent to the FSVO for assessment. If you enter Switzerland overland via the EU, the border veterinary inspection is carried out on entry into the EU. Entries from the EU into Switzerland are subject to random checks by customs to ensure compliance with entry regulations. It is prohibited to enter Switzerland with cropped or docked dogs (ears and/or tail). Regarding possible exceptions (short stay/holidays, moving house), please consult the animal welfare information [Questions and answers on dogs with short tails or clipped ears](https://www.blv.admin.ch/dam/blv/en/dokumente/import- export/import/fragen-antworten-rund-um-coupierte-hunde- db.pdf.download.pdf/Fragen_und_Antworten_rund_um_coupierte_Hunde- en.pdf). As a dog owner, you are required to register your animal(s) in your Swiss place of residence. Your veterinarian must additionally register the dog(s) in the Swiss dog database (AMICUS) within 10 days. This regulation applies solely to pets which are kept out of interest in the animal or as a household companion. Pets accompany their keepers or a person designated by the keepers. After being taken over the border, pets must not be sold or handed over to new keepers. They must already be in the care of their current keeper in the country of origin. If this is not the case, the import conditions for imports for commercial purposes apply. Information on this is available under: [Import for commercial purposes from EU]( https://www.blv.admin.ch/blv/en/home/import-und-export/import/importe-aus-der- eu/lebende-tiere-aus-der-eu/hunde-katzen-fraettchen-eu.html).

This information was compiled with the utmost care and to the best of our knowledge. However, the only legally binding text is the original text of the [Ordinance on the Import, Transit and Export of Pet Animals (OITE-AC in French)](http://www.admin.ch/opc/fr/classified-compilation/20140652/index.html). For accompanied import from a rabies risk country, the pet (dog, cat, ferret) needs the following: 1. Microchip The microchip must be electronically readable and must have been implanted BEFORE the rabies vaccination. 2. A valid rabies vaccination A rabies vaccination can only be considered valid if the microchip was implanted before the rabies vaccination. The rabies vaccination is invalid if it was done before the animal was 12 weeks old. 3. Blood analysis At the earliest 30 days after the rabies vaccination (but within the validity period of the vaccination), blood must be taken from the animal and subjected to a rabies antibody determination. This test must be carried out in a laboratory recognized by the EU. A list of recognized laboratories can be found at http://ec.europa.eu/food/animals/pet-movement/approved-labs_en. Following the blood analysis, there is another waiting period of 3 months from the date of blood collection until entry is possible, provided the result is at least 0.5 IU/ml. 4. Import permit from the BLV To enter Switzerland via a Swiss airport, a permit from the BLV is required. The following documents must be sent to the BLV via e-mail at infobew@blv.admin.ch at least 3 weeks before departure: 1. A copy of the blood analysis laboratory report, 2. Proof of the microchip with the date of implantation, 3. Proof of rabies vaccinations, 4. The application form. The permit costs 40 CHF. The amount will be collected by customs at entry. The sample of the application form can be found at the link mentioned above, at the bottom of the page under &quot;Further Information&quot; &gt; Forms &gt; https://www.blv.admin.ch/blv/de/home/tiere/reisen-mit-heimtieren/hunde-katzen-und- frettchen.html. 5. Veterinary certificate and owner declaration Must be issued by a government veterinarian or the competent authority in the country of origin. The sample of the veterinary certificate and owner declaration can be found at the link mentioned above, at the bottom of the page under &quot;Further Information&quot; &gt; Forms https://www.blv.admin.ch/blv/de/home/tiere/reisen-mit- heimtieren/hunde-katzen-und-frettchen.html. Attention! This certificate is valid for 10 days from the date of its issuance by the official veterinarian. We would like to point out that if the animal is not traveling with the owner in the passenger cabin, but in the cargo hold, it is essential to ensure that it is checked in as &quot;AVI in Hold&quot; or &quot;Excess baggage&quot;. This makes it clear to all parties involved (airline, border veterinarians, customs) that the animal is traveling with the owner. If the animal is not traveling with the owner on the same flight, please contact us again, as the entry requirements in this case differ slightly from those described above. Furthermore, the following applies: Contact the cantonal veterinary office before the entry of the dog to inquire about any restrictions or requirements for your dog breed. A list of addresses and phone numbers of the cantonal veterinary offices can be found at https://www.blv.admin.ch/blv/de/home/das-blv/organisation/veterinaerdienst- schweiz.html. Upon definitive import into Switzerland, the animal is subject to VAT; please contact the customs authorities upon arrival in this regard. Register with your municipality to be registered as a dog owner in the AMICUS database. Contact your Swiss veterinarian so that he can register the dog in the AMICUS database. The import of dogs with cropped ears or docked tails into Switzerland is prohibited with few exceptions.
